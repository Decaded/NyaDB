# Change Log

All notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

---

## [4.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decaded/nyadb/v/4.0.0) (10-03-2025)

### Changed

- **Multi-file storage system:**

  - Each database is now stored as a separate JSON file (`databaseName.json`) instead of a single `database.json` file.
  - This improves data isolation, reduces unnecessary file writes, and allows more efficient updates.

- **Automated Migration from v3.x:**
  - If an existing `database.json` is detected, NyaDB will **automatically split** it into multiple files, maintaining the original structure.
  - The old `database.json` will be **backed up** as `database_backup.json` in the `NyaDB` folder.

### Removed

- **Deprecated `database.json`:**
  - All operations now target individual database files instead of a centralized JSON file.
